% \chapter{Front Matter}

% The first thing is to connect the class by saying:

% \begin{snippet}
% \begin{verbatim}
% \documentclass{uvamscse}
% \end{verbatim}
% \end{snippet}

% \section{Title}

% Specify the title of the thesis with \cmd{title} and \cmd{subtitle} commands:

% \begin{snippet}
% \begin{verbatim}
% \title{MetaThesis}
% \subtitle{A Thesis Template Leading by Example}
% \end{verbatim}
% \end{snippet}

% Any thesis can survive without a \cmd{subtitle}, but the \cmd{title} is mandatory.

% \section{Author}

% Introduce yourself with \cmd{author} and \cmd{authemail}:

% \begin{snippet}
% \begin{verbatim}
% \author{Vadim Zaytsev}
% \authemail{vadim@grammarware.net}
% \end{verbatim}
% \end{snippet}

% Again, \cmd{authemail} is not mandatory. If you need anything fancier, just put it inside \cmd{author}.

% \begin{snippet}
% \begin{verbatim}
% \author{Vadim Zaytsev\footnote{Yes, that one.}}
% \end{verbatim}
% \end{snippet}

% The footnote would be printed on the bottom of the title page, and will be
% referred to by a symbol, not by a number as any footnotes within the main
% document body.

% \section{Date}

% By default, the date inserted in your PDF is the day of the build, e.g., ``March 25, 2014''. If you want it to be formatted differently or be more vague or outright fake, use \cmd{date}:

% \begin{snippet}
% \begin{verbatim}
% \date{Spring 2014}
% \end{verbatim}
% \end{snippet}

% The argument is just a string, the format is unrestricted:

% \begin{snippet}
% \begin{verbatim}
% \date{Tomorrow. Honestly.}
% \end{verbatim}
% \end{snippet}

% \section{Host}

% If your hosting organisation is not the UvA, specify it with \cmd{host}. The
% logo on the bottom of the title page will still be the UvA one, because this
% is the organisation guaranteeing your degree.

% \begin{snippet}
% \begin{verbatim}
% \host{Grammarware, Inc., \url{http://grammarware.github.io}}
% \end{verbatim}
% \end{snippet}

% NB: footnotes will not work, unless you know how to \cmd{protect} them.

% \section{Cover picture}

% If the first page of your thesis looks too blunt, add a picture to it:

% \begin{snippet}
% \begin{verbatim}
% \coverpic{figures/terminal.png}
% \end{verbatim}
% \end{snippet}

% You can even specify the picture's width as an optional argument:

% \begin{snippet}
% \begin{verbatim}
% \coverpic[100pt]{figures/terminal.png}
% \end{verbatim}
% \end{snippet}

% How these three options look, you can see from \autoref{fig:titles}.

% \begin{figure}[t]
%   \fbox{\includegraphics[width=.25\textwidth]{figures/title1.pdf}}
%   \hfill
%   \fbox{\includegraphics[width=.25\textwidth]{figures/title2.pdf}}
%   \hfill
%   \fbox{\includegraphics[width=.25\textwidth]{figures/title3.pdf}}
%   \caption{A hypothetical thesis title page without a cover picture (on the left), with an overly large one (in the centre) and with a tiny pic (on the right).}
%   \label{fig:titles}
% \end{figure}

% \section{Abstract}

% A thesis is fine without an abstract, if you do not feel like writing it and
% your supervisor does not feel like enforcing it. If you do want an abstract,
% make it with the \cmd{abstract} command:

% \begin{snippet}
% \begin{verbatim}
% \abstract{This is not a thesis.}
% \end{verbatim}
% \end{snippet}

% The abstract is just like any other section of your thesis, so you can use any
% \LaTeX\ tricks there. If you think that the name ``abstract'' is too abstract
% for your abstract, you can still use \cmd{abstract} without being too
% abstract:

% \begin{snippet}
% \begin{verbatim}
% \abstract[Confession]{I am a cenosillicaphobiac.}
% \end{verbatim}
% \end{snippet}

% Kent Beck~\cite{JohnsonBBCGW93} proposes to have four sentences in a good abstract:

% \begin{enumerate}
%   \item The first states the problem.
%   \item The second states why the problem is a problem.
%   \item The third is the startling sentence.
%   \item The fourth states the implication of the startling sentence.
% \end{enumerate}

% In practice, each of these ``sentences'' can be longer than an actual
% sentence, but it is in general a good rule of thumb to condense the summary of
% your thesis into these four tiny messages. Do not write too much, make it
% tweetable.

% \chapter{Core Chapters}

% The structure of your thesis is up to you and your supervisor. Whatever you
% do, do not consider the guidelines below as dogmas.

% \section{Classic structure}

% \begin{description}
%   \item[Problem statement and motivation.]
%   You describe in detail what problem the research is addressing, and what is
% the motivation to address this problem. There is a concise and objective
% statement of the research questions, hypotheses and goals. It is made clear
% why these questions and goals are important and relevant to the world outside
% the university (assuming it exists). You can already split the main research
% question into subquestions in this chapter. This section also describes an
% analysis of the problem: where does it occur and how, how often, and what are
% the consequences? An important part is also to scope the research: what
% aspects are included and what aspects are deliberately left out, and why?
%   \item[Research method.]
%   Here you describe the methods used to answer the research questions. A good
% structure of this section often follows the subquestions by providing a method
% for each. The research method needs a thorough motivation grounded in theory
% in order to be acceptable. As a part of the method, you can introduce a number
% of hypotheses --- these will be tested by the research, using the methods
% described here. An important part of this section is validation. How will you
% evaluate and validate the outcomes of the research?
%   \item[Background and context.]
%   This chapter contains all the information needed to put the thesis into
% context. It is common to use a revised version of your literature survey for
% this purpose. It is important to explicitly refer from your text to sources
% you have used, they will be listed in your bibliography. For example, you can
% write ``A small number of programming languages account for most language
% use~\cite{MeyerovichR2013}'', where the following entry would be included in
% your bibliography:
% \begin{quote}
% \cite{MeyerovichR2013} Leo A. Meyerovich and Ariel S. Rabkin. Empirical Analysis of Programming Language Adoption. In \emph{Proceedings of the 2013 ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Object Oriented Programming Systems Languages and Applications}, OOPSLA, pages 1--18. ACM, 2013. \doi{10.1145/2509136.2509515}.
% \end{quote}
% Have a look at \autoref{sec:biblio} to learn more about citation.
%   \item[Research.]
%   This chapter reports on the execution of the research method as described in
% an earlier chapter. If the research has been divided into phases, they are
% introduced, reported on and concluded individually. If needed, this chapter
% could be split up to balance out the sizes of all chapters.
%   \item[Results.]
%   This chapter presents and clarifies the results obtained during the
%   research. The focus should be on the factual results, not the interpretation
%   or discussion. Tables and graphics should be used to increase the clarity of
%   the results where applicable.
%   \item[Analysis and conclusions.]
%   This chapter contains the analysis and interpretation of the results. The
%   research questions are answered as best as possible with the results that
%   were obtained. The analysis also discussed parts of the questions that were
%   left unanswered.

%   An important topic is the validity of the results. What methods of
%   validation were used? Could the results be generalised to other cases? What
%   threats to validity can be identified? There is room here to discuss the
%   results of related scientific literature here as well. How do the results
%   obtained here relate to other work, and what consequences are there? Did
%   your approach work better or worse? Did you learn anything new compared to
%   the already existing body of knowledge? Finally, what could you say in
%   hindsight on the research approach by followed? What could have done better?
%   What lessons have been learned? What could other researchers use from your
%   experience? A separate section should be devoted to ``future work'', i.e.,
%   possible extension points of your work that you have identified. Even other
%   researchers should be able to use those as a starting point.
% \end{description}

% \section{Reporting on replications}

% Here are the guidelines to report on replicated studies~\cite{Carver10}:

% \begin{description}
%   \item[Information about the original study]~\\
%     \begin{description}
%     \item[Research question(s)] that were the basis for the design
%     \item[Participants,] their number and any other relevant characteristics
%     \item[Design] as a graphical or textual description of the experimental design
%     \item[Artefacts,] the description of them and/or links to the artefacts used
%     \item[Context variables] as any important details that affected the design of the study or interpretation of the 
% results
%     \item[Summary of the results] in a brief overview of the major findings
%     \end{description}
%   %
%   \item[Information about the replication]~\\
%     \begin{description}
%     \item[Motivation for conducting the replication] as a 
% description of why the replication was conducted: 
% to validate the results, to broaden the results by 
% changing the participant pool or the artifacts. 
%     \item[Level of interaction with original experimenters.]
% The level of interaction between the original experimenters and the
% replicators should be reported. This interaction could range from none (i.e.
% simply read the  paper) to them being the same people. There is quite a lot of
% discussion of the level of interaction allowed for the replication to be
% ``successful'', but this level should be reported even without  addressing
% the controversy.
%     \item[Changes to the original experiment.] Any changes made to the
% design, participants, artifacts, procedures, data collected and/or analysis
% techniques should be  discussed along with the motivation for the change.
%     \end{description}
%   \item[Comparison of results to original]~\\
%     \begin{description}
%     \item[Consistent results,] when replication results supported 
% results from the original study, and 
%     \item[Differences in results,] when results from the replication 
% did not coincide with the results from the original study. 
% Authors should also discuss how changes made to the 
% experimental design (see above) may have caused 
% these differences. 
%     \end{description}
%     \item[Drawing conclusions across studies]
% \end{description}

% NB: this section contains portions of text repeated directly from Carver~\cite{Carver10} and 
% only slightly massaged. Do not do this for your thesis, write your own thoughts down.

% \chapter{Literature}\label{sec:biblio}

% \textsc{Bib}TeX\ is a JSON-like format for bibliographic entries. Encode each
% source once as a \textsc{Bib}\TeX\ entry, give it a name and refer to it from
% any place in your thesis. The bibliography at the end of the thesis will be
% compiled automatically from those entries that are referenced at least once,
% it will also be automatically sorted and fancyfied (URLs, DOIs, etc).

% DOI is a digital object identifier, it is uniquely and immutably assigned to
% any paper published in a well-established journal or conference proceedings
% and can be used to refer to it. When used in a browser, it resolves to a
% publisher's website where paper can be obtained. Including DOIs in citations
% is considered good practice and lets the readers of your thesis get to the
% text of the paper in one click. Books do not have DOIs, only ISBNs; some
% workshop proceedings and most unofficial publications do not have DOIs. If you
% want to get a DOI assigned to your work such as a piece of code, upload it to
% \href{http://www.figshare.com}{FigShare}.

% Keys in key-value pairs within each \textsc{Bib}\TeX\ entry are never quoted,
% values usually are, but can also be included within curly brackets or left as
% is, which works fine for numbers (e.g., years). If you want to preserve the
% value from any adjustments (e.g., no recapitalisation in titles), use curlies
% \emph{and} quotes. Separate authors and editors by ``and'', which will
% automatically be mapped to commas or left as ``and''s as necessary.

% \section{Books}

% \cite{GruneJacobs} is just as good as the Dragon Book, but newer and has an
% awesome extended bibliography available for free.

% \begin{snippet}

% \end{verbatim}
% \end{snippet}

% There is also \texttt{mastersthesis} type with exactly the same structure for
% referring to Master's theses.

% \section{Technical reports}

% The original seminal work introducing two-level grammars was never published
% in any book or conference, but there is a technical report explaining
% it~\cite{Wijngaarden65}. SMC, or \emph{Stichting Matematisch Centrum}, was the
% old name of CWI fifty years ago.

%         month       = oct,
%         year        = 1965,
%         institution = "SMC",

% }
% \end{verbatim}
% \end{snippet}

% \section{Wikipedia}

% You do not refer to Wikipedia from academic writing, it works the other way around.

% \section{Anything else}

% You can refer to pretty much anything (websites, blog posts, software) through
% \texttt{misc} type of entry~\cite{ANTLR}:

% \begin{snippet}
