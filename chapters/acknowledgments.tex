\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my supervisor,
dr. Jurgen J. Vinju, the academic supervisor. He guided me throughout this the
thesis, put me in the right direction and always came up with useful
suggestions. Without him, the thesis would have taken a different turn.
Also, I would like to thank Jouke Stoel, who does his PhD in the field of
\textit{Rebel}, for sharing his knowledge. He has also added functionality in
the \textit{Rebel} toolchain so that I can carry out my research.

Special thanks go to Jorryt-Jan Dijkstra, my company supervisor, for giving
the opportunity to work on my thesis at ING, and for providing feedback on
my work. I want to thank my colleagues of ING for the knowledge they have
shared. I would also like to thank my co-intern Alex Kok from the UvA, who is
also doing his thesis in the field of \textit{Rebel}. Thanks also go to my
fellow students during my master Software Engineering. I would like to thank
also UvA teacher dr. Ana Oprescu, who is always willing to help students.

Finally, I would like to thank my family and friends who supported me throughout
the master.
