\chapter{Background}\label{sec:ch2}

\section{Rebel}

\textit{Rebel} is a formal specification language written in the language
workbench Rascal~\cite{RascalGTTSE}. The specification language is developed by
ING\footnote{\url{https://www.ing.nl/}} and
\gls{cwi}\footnote{\url{https://www.cwi.nl/}}.

The language is used for controlling the intrinsic complexity of software for
financial enterprise systems.~\cite[p.~1]{stoel_storm_vinju_bosman_2016} The
goal of \textit{Rebel} is to develop applications based on verified
specifications that are easy to write and understand.
The formal specification language makes product descriptions more precise, and
it removes the ambiguity. The simulation in the language is used as an early
prototyping mechanism to verify the product with the user. For example,
\textit{Rebel} can specify banking products like savings accounts.

The mapping of the \textit{Rebel} language to the \gls{smt} formulas makes it
possible to simulate and check these specifications. Simulation and checking
specifications can be used for early fault detection.

\subsection{Example specification}
An example of a \textit{Rebel} specification is given in
\autoref{fig:simple-account-spec}. The specification specifies a simple account
where it is only possible to open an account with some balance. After opening an
account, the state of the account goes to the opened state which is also the
final state. When the account is in its final state, no further action is
allowed. Notice also the fields of the specification; these are the account
number of type \textit{IBAN} and balance of type \textit{Money}.

\begin{sourcecode}[h!]
\begin{lstlisting}[]
specification Account {
	fields {
		accountNumber: IBAN @key
		balance: Money
	}

	events {
		openAccount[]
	}

	lifeCycle {
		initial init -> opened: openAccount
		final opened
	}
}
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{A simple account specification}\label{fig:simple-account-spec}
\end{sourcecode}
\FloatBarrier

As shown in the specification, it describes only what is possible with an
account and not how. The specification does not contain the definition of the
transitions (events). These definitions are specified somewhere else to promote reuse of
transitions and invariants for other \textit{Rebel} entities, and to make
\textit{Rebel} specifications more concise.~\cite[p.~4]{stoel_storm_vinju_bosman_2016}

The definition of the transition \textit{openAccount} is illustrated in
\autoref{fig:account-openaccount-event}. The precondition of the transition is
that the initial deposit should be equal or above 0 euro. The keyword new is
used in the postcondition to refer to the value of the variable in the
post-state after the execution of the transition.~\cite[p.~4]{stoel_storm_vinju_bosman_2016}

\begin{sourcecode}[h!]
\begin{lstlisting}[]
event openAccount[minimalDeposit: Money = EUR 0.00](initialDeposit: Money) {
	preconditions {
		initialDeposit >= minimalDeposit;
	}
	postconditions {
		new this.balance == initialDeposit;
	}
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Code generation}\label{sec:ch2-codegen}

Writing programs that write programs is called code
generation.~\cite[p.~3]{herrington2003code} The code generators of ING Bank are
capable of generating source code from a \textit{Rebel} specification.
These generators are a template-based generator which uses Rascal (which has a
page-template feature)~\cite{RascalGTTSE} to build code.
Generating code from templates preserves consistent code quality throughout the
entire code base. Even when a bug is encountered or improvements are made in
generated code, in short time these errors can be fixed through revising the
templates and starting the code generation process.~\cite[p.~15-17]{herrington2003code}
These fixes are applied consistently throughout the code base.

The following generators exist right now for \textit{Rebel}:
\begin{itemize}

\item Codegen-Akka: The Codegen-Akka generator generates a Scala system from
\textit{Rebel} specifications. The generated system uses
Akka~\cite[p.~4]{roestenburg2016akka} as Actor Model and
Cassandra~\cite{lakshman2010cassandra} is used for storage.

\item Codegen-Javadatomic: This generator generates a Java system based on the
\textit{Rebel} specifications. The generated system uses
Datomic~\cite[p.~170-172]{anderson2016professional} for storage.

\item Codegen-Scala-ES: The Codegen-Scala-ES generator also generates a Scala
system. The implementation of the generated system uses
\gls{cqrs}~\cite{fowler2011cqrs} and Event Sourcing~\cite{fowler2005event}.

\end{itemize}

The \gls{api}'s of the generated system from the code generators are not completely
standardised. The request which is made for transitions are all implemented in
the same way between the code generators. However, the response returned by the
generated system may differ. For example a request for the transition given in
\autoref{fig:account-openaccount-event} looks as follows:

\begin{center}
	\code{\{ "OpenAccount": \{ "initialDeposit": "EUR 50.00" \} \}}
\end{center}

Since the interactions for transitions within the generated systems are the
same, all three code generators can be used to test the implementation of
\textit{Rebel} specifications.

\section{Simulation and Checking Specifications}

% Here we describe two verification techniques we implemented for \textit{Rebel} (both use a similar encoding).

The semantics of \textit{Rebel} is defined as labelled transition
systems.~\cite[p.~5]{stoel_storm_vinju_bosman_2016} Thus the current state of a
specification holds the state name with the current fields assignments and the
transition parameters which causes the current state. The labelled transitions map
to the transitions and their preconditions and postconditions. \textit{Rebel} has
also support to specify invariants for a given specification. These are
predicates which should always be true during the lifecycle of an instance of
the specification.

Bounded model checking can be used for \textit{Rebel} specifications. Therefore,
\textit{Rebel} is defined as an \gls{smt} problem by encoding it to symbolic
bounded model checking (with data). The goal of model checking is to find a
state which is reachable with some properties which don't
hold.~\cite[p.~5]{stoel_storm_vinju_bosman_2016} For example, for the
specification from \autoref{fig:simple-account-spec}, an account within the
state opened with a negative balance. \textit{Rebel} uses \gls{smt} solver
Z3~\cite{moura_bjorner_2008} for simulation and checking.

\subsection{Bounded checking}

Checking of \textit{Rebel} specifications is used to check the consistency of a
given specification.~\cite[p.~5]{stoel_storm_vinju_bosman_2016} A specification
is consistent when invariants hold in all reachable states. A state is reachable
when it can be reached from the initial state via valid transitions.

The bounded analysis tries to find the smallest (the least possible steps within
bounds) possible counterexample; this is fully automatic and incremental.
Thus the given computations by the \gls{smt} solver satisfies the route from
pre-condition to post-condition for every transition.
First, it tries to reach an invalid state in one step. If that did not succeed,
then it tries to reach the invalid state in two steps. This process continues
until a counterexample is found or configurable timeout (bound) is met.
A configurable timeout is used to control the maximum spent waiting time of the
user.~\cite[p.~5]{stoel_storm_vinju_bosman_2016}

An example of checking \textit{Rebel} specifications is given in
\autoref{fig:tebl-opened-simple-account}. These checks can be defined in
so-called tebl files. As configurable time-out is six used.
In this case, the \gls{smt} solver tries to find the smallest possible
counterexample with an opened account with the balance above 0 euro.
The \gls{smt} solver checks incremental whether the state can be reached in
steps until a counterexample is found or the configuration timeout (bound) is
reached.

\begin{sourcecode}[h!]
\begin{lstlisting}[]
module simple_transaction.OpenAccountCheck

import simple_transaction.Account

state openAccountCheck {
  opened Account with balance > EUR 0.00;
}

check openAccountCheck reachable in max 6 steps;
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{Checking opened account}\label{fig:tebl-opened-simple-account}
\end{sourcecode}
\FloatBarrier

\subsection{Simulation}
The purpose of simulation and checking differs. As explained in the
previous paragraph, checking is used to reason about possible counterexamples.
Simulation focuses on individual steps to reason about. Thus with the simulator,
the user can quickly check the specification behaves as expected. As for
checking, the same strategy is used in the simulation, \textit{i.e.}, using
\gls{smt} solver and encoding for \textit{Rebel} Specifications.
